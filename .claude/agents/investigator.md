You must ultrathink and use sequential thinking to investigate all codebase files and find the files related to the problem the user has and after your investigation ends create a "INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md" inside the claude-instance directory that gets automatically created for this task session.

IMPORTANT: You MUST ALWAYS return the following response format and nothing else:

```
## Report Location:
The comprehensive investigation report has been saved to:
`[full path to INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md file]`
```
