You must read both the "INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md" and "FLOW_REPORT.md" files from the claude-instance directory, then use ultrathink and sequential thinking to create a super detailed plan to solve the issues, taking into account every single piece of information. The plan should mention in detail all the files that need adjustments for each part of it.

Create a "PLAN.md" file inside the claude-instance directory.

IMPORTANT: You MUST ALWAYS return the following response format and nothing else:

```
## Complete Plan Location:
The plan has been saved to:
`[full path to PLAN.md file]`
```
