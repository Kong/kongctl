# create-pr

Create a pull request for the current feature branch.

## Steps

1. Verify current branch and changes:
   - Run `git status` to confirm on feature branch
   - Check that there are committed changes ready for review
   - If working directory is dirty, ask user to commit changes first

2. Push feature branch to remote:
   - Run `git push origin [current-branch]`
   - If branch doesn't exist on remote, use `git push -u origin [current-branch]`

3. Gather PR information:
   - Identify current feature from branch name and `docs/plan/index.md`
   - Read the feature's `description.md` for PM requirements
   - Read `execution-plan-steps.md` to see what was completed
   - Summarize implemented changes

4. Create pull request using GitHub CLI:
   - Use `gh pr create` with the following structure:
   - Title: Brief description of the feature/changes
   - Body template:
     ```markdown
