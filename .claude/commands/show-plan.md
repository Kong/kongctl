Development Plan: Declarative Configuration - Stage 1
=====================================================

Feature: Configuration Format & Basic CLI
Folder: docs/plan/001-dec-cfg-cfg-format-basic-cli/

Goals:
- Establish YAML configuration format
- Integrate basic commands (plan, apply, export)
- Implement resource validation
- Support basic workflows

Technical Approach:
- Embed SDK types in configuration structures
- Use type-specific ResourceSet for type safety
- Implement reference resolution with validation
- Create command stubs first, then add functionality

Implementation Steps:
--------------------
âœ… Step 1: Add Verb Constants
   Status: Completed
   Define constants for plan, apply, sync operations

âœ… Step 2: Define Command Structure  
   Status: Completed
   Create basic command hierarchy

âœ… Step 3: Add Command Factories
   Status: Completed
   Implement factory functions for commands

ðŸ“‹ Step 4: Create command stubs [NEXT]
   Status: Not Started
   Add stub implementations for plan, apply, export

ðŸ“‹ Step 5: Implement YAML loading
   Status: Not Started
   Add YAML parsing and validation

ðŸ“‹ Step 6: Add resource validation
   Status: Not Started
   Implement resource type validation

ðŸ“‹ Step 7: Integration tests
   Status: Not Started
   Add end-to-end tests for commands

Progress: 3/7 steps completed (43%)

Current Focus: Ready to implement Step 4
Use /implement-next to begin work on command stubs.
