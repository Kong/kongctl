# status

Show the current development status, progress, and next steps.

## Steps

1. Read the current active development from `docs/plan/index.md`:
   - Find the "Current Active Stage" section
   - Note the feature name and stage

2. Navigate to the current feature folder and read `execution-plan-steps.md`:
   - Find the Progress Summary table
   - Count completed vs total steps
   - Identify the next "Not Started" step

3. Check for any work in progress:
   - Look for steps marked as "In Progress"
   - Note if any steps are blocked

4. Run a quick git status to check for uncommitted changes:
   - Run `git status --short`

5. Display a comprehensive status report including:
   - Current feature/stage name
   - Overall progress (X/Y steps completed)
   - Current step in progress (if any)
   - Next step to implement
   - Any blockers or issues
   - Uncommitted changes (if any)
