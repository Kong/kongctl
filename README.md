## What is `kongctl`?

`kongctl` is a command-line tool for Kong Konnect that enables you to:
- Manage Konnect resources programmatically
- Define your Konnect API infrastructure as code using declarative configuration
- Integrate Konnect into your CI/CD pipelines
- Automate API lifecycle management

*Note: Future releases may include support for Kong Gateway on-premise deployments.*

## Installation

### macOS

Install using Homebrew (distributed as a cask):

```shell
brew install --cask kong/kongctl/kongctl
```

If you previously installed the old formula, remove it first with `brew uninstall kongctl`.

### Linux

Download from the [release page](https://github.com/kong/kongctl/releases):

```shell
# Example: Install v0.0.12 for x86-64
curl -sL https://github.com/Kong/kongctl/releases/download/v0.0.12/kongctl_linux_amd64.zip -o kongctl_linux_amd64.zip
unzip kongctl_linux_amd64.zip -d /tmp
sudo cp /tmp/kongctl /usr/local/bin/
```

### Verify

```shell
kongctl version --full
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Create a Kong Konnect Account

If you don't have a Kong Konnect account, [sign up for free](https://konghq.com/products/kong-konnect/register).

### 2. Authenticate with Konnect

Use the `kongctl login` command to authenticate with you Kong Konnect account:

```shell
kongctl login
```

Follow the instructions given in the terminal to complete the login process.

### 3. Test the Authentication

You can verify that `kongctl` is authenticated and can access information on your Konnect account by running:

```shell
kongctl get me
kongctl get organization
```

### 4. Switch Konnect Regions

By default `kongctl` uses the `us` region for Konnect API requests. Until a 
feature is developed to easily support region switching, you need to set 
the `base-url` configuration to route requests to a different region.

You can set the `base-url` using the `--base-url` flag or by configuring it in your
profile. The `base-url` format is `https://<region>.api.konghq.com`, where `<region>` is
the region code (for example, `eu` for Europe). The [documentation](https://developer.konghq.com/konnect-platform/geos/)
provides a list of available regions.

Here is an example configuration snippet to set the `default` profile to use the `eu` region:
```yaml
default:
    ...
    konnect:
      base-url: https://eu.api.konghq.com
    ...
```

## Configuration and Profiles

`kongctl` configuration data is read from `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kongctl` and falls back to 
`$HOME/.config/kongctl`. The standard configuration file (YAML format) is located in this location and is named 
`config.yaml`. At the root level you specify profiles where a profile is a named collection of 
configuration values. By default there is a `default` profile, but you can 
create additional profiles for different environments or configurations.

Some flags and options can be changed by providing a value in the configuration file, effectively 
allowing you to override the default behavior of command options. Flags that support this will 
be documented in the command help text with a "Config path" note that looks like this:

```text
-o, --output string        Configures the format of data written to STDOUT.
                             - Config path: [ output ]
                             - Allowed    : [ json|yaml|text ] (default "text")
```

The above help text shows a YAML key path for the `--output` flag which controls the format of output text
from the CLI. The config path is the location in the configuration file where a flag value can be defaulted. 
In this case it specifies that output formats can be set in the configuration file under an `output` key. 

The basic example of a configuration file follows:

```yaml
default:
  output: text
second-profile:
  output: json
```

Specifying a profile can be done using the `--profile` flag or by setting or exporting
the `KONGCTL_PROFILE` environment variable.

Configuration values can also be specified using environment variables. `kongctl` looks for environment variables
which follow the pattern `KONGCTL_<PROFILE>_<PATH>`, where `<PROFILE>` is the profile name in uppercase and `<PATH>` 
is the configuration path in uppercase. For example, to set the output format for the `default` profile, you can use:

```shell
KONGCTL_DEFAULT_OUTPUT=yaml kongctl get apis 
```

### Authentication Options

`kongctl` makes requests to the Konnect API using API tokens. There are two primary methods for authentication.

1. **Device Flow** (Recommended):

   Execute the following command to authorize `kongctl` with your Kong Konnect account:

   ```shell
   kongctl login
   ```

   This command will generate a web link you can use to open a browser window and authenticate with your Kong Konnect account. 
   After logging in and authorizing the CLI using the provided code, `kongctl` will store token and refresh token data in a file at 
   `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kongctl/.<profile>-konnect-token.json`

2. **Personal Access Token flag**:

   You can also pass an API token directly using the `--pat` flag. This is useful for automation pipelines 
   where you want to avoid interactive login or provide various tokens for different operations.

   ```shell
   kongctl get apis --pat <token>
   ```

   You can also set an environment variable for the token following the same pattern as configuration values:

   ```
   KONGCTL_DEFAULT_KONNECT_PAT=<token> kongctl get apis
   ```

### Color Themes

Interactive experiences, such as `kongctl kai` or `kongctl view`, share a configurable 
color theme. Use the `--color-theme` flag (or set the `color-theme` key in your configuration file) 
to select a palette. The default `kong` theme mirrors the existing brand styling, and you can switch to any
[`bubbletint`](https://github.com/lrstanley/bubbletint) theme by ID, for example:

```yaml
default:
  color-theme: tokyo_night
```

## Command Structure

Commands generally follow a verb->product->resource->args pattern with `konnect` as the default product.

```shell
kongctl <verb> <product> <resource-type> [resource-name] [flags]
```

Examples:
- `kongctl get apis` - List all APIs in Konnect (`konnect` product is implicit)
- `kongctl get konnect apis` - List all APIs in Konnect (using full product name)
- `kongctl get api users-api` - Get specific API details
- `kongctl delete api my-api` - Delete an API from Konnect
