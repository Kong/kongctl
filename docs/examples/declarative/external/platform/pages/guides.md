# Developer Guides

Comprehensive guides to help you integrate with our platform effectively. These guides cover everything from basic concepts to advanced implementation patterns.

## Quick Reference

- **[Authentication](/guides/authentication)** - Learn how to authenticate with our APIs
- **[Rate Limits](/guides/rate-limits)** - Understand rate limiting and best practices

## Authentication

Secure your API calls with proper authentication. We support multiple authentication methods depending on your use case:

- **API Keys** - For server-to-server communication
- **OAuth 2.0** - For user-facing applications
- **JWT Tokens** - For session-based authentication

[Read the Authentication Guide →](/guides/authentication)

## Rate Limits

Our APIs implement rate limiting to ensure fair usage and system stability. Learn how to:

- Understand rate limit headers
- Handle rate limit responses
- Implement exponential backoff
- Optimize your request patterns

## Best Practices

### Error Handling
Always implement proper error handling for API responses:

```javascript
try {
  const response = await fetch('/api/endpoint');
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}: ${response.statusText}`);
  }
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
} catch (error) {
  console.error('API call failed:', error.message);
  // Handle error appropriately
}
```

### Request Optimization
- Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Include only necessary data in requests
- Cache responses when appropriate
- Use compression for large payloads

### Security
- Never expose API keys in client-side code
- Use HTTPS for all API calls
- Validate and sanitize all input data
- Implement proper session management

## SDKs and Tools

While we're working on official SDKs, here are some community tools and resources:

- **Postman Collection** - Import our API collection for testing
- **OpenAPI Specifications** - Use our OpenAPI specs with code generators
- **Sample Applications** - Reference implementations in various languages
