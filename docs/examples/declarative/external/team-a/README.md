# Team A Configuration - Customer Analytics API

This configuration demonstrates how Team A manages their Customer Analytics API while publishing to an external portal managed by the platform team.

## Overview

Team A is responsible for:
- Customer Analytics API development and maintenance
- Customer data processing and insights
- API documentation and developer experience
- Publishing to the shared developer portal (external reference)

## API Configuration

The Customer Analytics API provides:

### Core Features (v1.2.0)
- **Customer Profiles**: Complete customer lifecycle management
- **Event Tracking**: Real-time behavioral event capture  
- **Segmentation**: Dynamic customer grouping and targeting
- **Analytics Reports**: Pre-built insights and reporting
- **Real-time Processing**: Low-latency data processing

### Key Endpoints
- `GET /customers` - List and search customers
- `GET /customers/{id}/events` - Customer event history
- `POST /events` - Track customer events
- `GET /segments` - Customer segmentation
- `GET /analytics/reports` - Analytics and insights

## External Portal Reference

The configuration includes an external portal reference:

```yaml
# External portal definition
portals:
  - ref: shared-developer-portal
    _external:
      selector:
        matchFields:
          name: "Shared Developer Portal"

# API publication to external portal
publications:
  - ref: customer-analytics-to-shared-portal
    portal_id: !ref shared-developer-portal#id
    visibility: public
```

This approach allows Team A to:
1. Reference the platform team's portal without managing it
2. Publish their API to the shared portal automatically
3. Focus on API development rather than portal management

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **Shared Developer Portal**: Managed by platform team
- **Platform Core API**: Authentication and user management

### Deployment Order
1. Platform team must deploy the shared portal first
2. Team A can then deploy their API configuration
3. API will be automatically published to the shared portal

## Deployment

```bash
# Ensure platform portal exists first
cd ../platform/
kongctl apply portal.yaml api.yaml

# Deploy Team A configuration  
cd ../team-a/
kongctl apply api.yaml
```

```

### Customer Segmentation
