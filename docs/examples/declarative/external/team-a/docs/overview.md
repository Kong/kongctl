## Core Concepts

### Customers
Individual users or entities that interact with your service. Each customer has:
- Unique identifier
- Profile information (email, name, preferences)
- Behavioral history and event timeline
- Segment memberships
- Calculated metrics (lifetime value, purchase frequency)

### Events
Actions that customers take within your application:
- **Page Views** - Website navigation tracking
- **Purchases** - Transaction completions
- **Signups** - Account registrations  
- **Logins** - Authentication events
- **Downloads** - Content downloads

### Segments
Dynamic groups of customers based on shared characteristics or behaviors:
- **Demographic segments** - Age, location, occupation
- **Behavioral segments** - Purchase history, engagement level
- **Value segments** - Lifetime value, purchase frequency
- **Custom segments** - Your own business logic

### Analytics Reports
Pre-built analytical views of your customer data:
- **Customer Acquisition** - New customer growth and sources
- **Retention Analysis** - Customer stickiness and churn
- **Engagement Metrics** - Activity levels and patterns
- **Revenue Analytics** - Purchase behavior and trends

## Use Cases

### E-commerce Analytics
Track customer purchase behavior and optimize conversion:

```javascript
// Track a purchase event
await analytics.trackEvent({
  customer_id: 'customer_123',
  event_type: 'purchase',
  properties: {
    order_id: 'order_789',
    amount: 99.99,
    items: ['product_1', 'product_2'],
    payment_method: 'credit_card'
  }
});

// Get high-value customers
const highValueCustomers = await analytics.getSegmentCustomers('high_value_segment');
```

### Content Platform Analytics
Understand content consumption and user engagement:

```javascript
// Track content engagement
await analytics.trackEvent({
  customer_id: 'user_456',
  event_type: 'page_view',
  properties: {
    content_type: 'article',
    content_id: 'article_123',
    time_spent: 180,
    scroll_depth: 0.85
  }
});

// Analyze content performance
const engagementReport = await analytics.getAnalyticsReports({
  report_type: 'engagement',
  start_date: '2024-01-01',
  end_date: '2024-01-31'
});
```

### SaaS Product Analytics
Track feature usage and customer health:

```javascript
// Track feature usage
await analytics.trackEvent({
  customer_id: 'company_789',
  event_type: 'feature_used',
  properties: {
    feature_name: 'advanced_reporting',
    plan_type: 'enterprise',
    user_role: 'admin'
  }
});

// Identify at-risk customers
const atRiskSegment = await analytics.createSegment({
  name: 'At Risk Customers',
  criteria: {
    last_active_days: 30,
    feature_usage_decline: 0.5
  }
});
```

## Integration Patterns

### Real-time Event Streaming
```javascript
// Stream events as they happen
const eventStream = analytics.createEventStream();
eventStream.on('customer_event', (event) => {
  console.log('New event:', event);
  // Process event in real-time
});
```

### Batch Analytics Processing
```javascript
// Process analytics in batches
const batchProcessor = analytics.createBatchProcessor({
  interval: '1hour',
  events: ['purchase', 'signup']
});

batchProcessor.process(async (events) => {
  // Process batch of events
  const insights = await generateInsights(events);
  await updateDashboards(insights);
});
```

### Webhook Integration
```javascript
// Set up webhooks for segment changes
analytics.createWebhook({
  url: 'https://your-app.com/webhooks/analytics',
  events: ['segment.customer_added', 'segment.customer_removed']
});
```
