          # Getting Started with Internal APIs
          
          Welcome to our internal API portal. This guide will help you:
          
          1. **Obtain API credentials** - Contact the platform team
          2. **Explore available APIs** - Browse our API catalog
          3. **Make your first request** - Follow our quickstart guide
          
          ## Authentication
          
          All internal APIs use API key authentication. Include your key in 
          the `X-API-Key` header with all requests.

          All teams building APIs should follow these guidelines:
          
          - Use RESTful design principles
          - Version your APIs appropriately
          - Document all endpoints thoroughly
          - Include example requests and responses
          - Follow our naming conventions
