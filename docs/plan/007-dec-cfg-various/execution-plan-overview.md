# Stage 7: Testing, Documentation, and Core Improvements - Execution Plan Overview

## Objective
Complete essential testing, documentation, and core improvements for 
declarative configuration management, focusing on production readiness and 
user experience.

## Success Criteria
1. Login command simplified to Konnect-first approach
2. Comprehensive documentation available for users
3. Full integration test coverage for all commands
4. Enhanced error messages and user feedback
5. Migration to public SDK completed
6. Code quality improved through refactoring

## Technical Approach

### 1. User Experience First
Start with the most visible user improvements:
- Simplify login command to remove product specification
- Create comprehensive documentation
- Improve error messages and feedback

### 2. Quality Through Testing
Ensure reliability with comprehensive testing:
- Integration tests for all command flows
- Error scenario coverage
- Idempotency verification

### 3. Technical Debt Reduction
Complete technical improvements:
- Migrate to public SDK
- Reduce code duplication
- Improve maintainability

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Steps 1-2)
Focus on immediately visible improvements:
- Login command migration
- Documentation creation

### Phase 2: Quality Assurance (Steps 3-5)
Build comprehensive test coverage:
- Apply command tests
- Sync command tests
- Error scenario tests

### Phase 3: Polish (Steps 6-8)
Enhance user experience:
- Better error messages
- Improved plan display
- Progress indicators

### Phase 4: Technical Completion (Steps 9-10)
Finish technical improvements:
- SDK migration
- Code refactoring

## Risk Mitigation

### Backward Compatibility
- Maintain old login syntax with deprecation warning
- Ensure no breaking changes for existing users
- Test migration paths thoroughly

### Testing Coverage
- Start with integration tests to catch real issues
- Focus on user workflows
- Cover error cases comprehensively

### Documentation Quality
- Test all examples before publishing
- Get user feedback on clarity
- Keep documentation in sync with code

## Dependencies
- Completion of Stages 1-6
- Access to Konnect test environment
- Understanding of common user workflows

## Estimated Timeline
- Phase 1: 2-3 days
- Phase 2: 3-4 days
- Phase 3: 2-3 days
- Phase 4: 2-3 days
- Total: ~10-13 days

## Definition of Done
- All tests passing with >80% coverage
- Documentation complete and reviewed
- No internal SDK usage remaining
- User feedback incorporated
- Code quality metrics improved
