## Quick Start for Implementation

1. **For Users**: [user-guide.md](user-guide.md) - Commands to direct Claude Code effectively
2. **For Claude Code**: [implementation-guide.md](implementation-guide.md) - Implementation workflow and document structure
3. **Check current progress**: Use implementation guide linked above
4. **Start implementing**: Follow the next "Not Started" step

### üéÆ Directing Claude Code

Use custom commands to streamline development:
- `/start-session` - Begin a new development session
- `/status` - Check current progress
- `/implement-next` - Implement the next step
- See [user-guide.md](user-guide.md) for all commands

**To continue implementation**: Work on Step 13 in [004-dec-cfg-multi-resource/execution-plan-steps.md](004-dec-cfg-multi-resource/execution-plan-steps.md)

### üéØ Entry Points for Claude Code

1. **Check progress**: Progress Summary table shows current status
2. **Find next step**: Look for first "Not Started" step with resolved dependencies  
3. **Get context**: Read step details and reference ADRs as needed
4. **Update status**: Mark step "In Progress" before starting, "Completed" when done

## Key Design Decisions

### Declarative Configuration (Stage 1)
- **Per-resource reference mappings** instead of global mappings (ADR-001-008)
- **Separate `ref` field** for cross-resource references (ADR-001-003) 
- **SDK type embedding** to avoid duplication (ADR-001-002)
- **Type-specific ResourceSet** for clarity and safety (ADR-001-001)

### Plan Generation (Stage 2)
- **Label-based resource management** with KONGCTL/managed, KONGCTL/config-hash, KONGCTL/protected
- **Semantic change IDs** for human-readable plan identification
- **Minimal field storage** to reduce plan size and focus on actual changes
- **Protection status isolation** from regular field updates
- **Dependency-ordered execution** for proper resource creation order

### Plan Execution (Stage 3)
- **Mode-aware plan generation** with separate apply and sync modes
- **Fail-fast protection handling** - planning fails if protected resources would be modified
- **Execution-time validation** for protection status changes
- **Configuration-based change detection** (ADR-003-011) - only manage fields in user config
- **Protection label always present** with true/false value for consistency
- **stdin support with TTY separation** for Unix-like systems

### Multi-Resource Support (Stage 4)
- **API-centric design** - APIs as primary resources with child resources
- **Flexible configuration** - support both nested and separate file approaches
- **Reference-based dependencies** - resources reference each other by ref field
- **Topological ordering** - ensure correct creation/deletion order

## General Testing Strategy

- **Test-first approach** for business logic
- **Focus on our code**, not third-party libraries
- **Integration tests** for command execution
- **Feature-specific validation** based on requirements

## Stage Transition Process

When moving between stages, update this file to reflect the new current active stage:

1. **Complete current stage**: Mark all steps as "Completed" in current execution plan
2. **Update Current Active Stage section**: Change stage number, links, and status
3. **Update Stage Overview**: Move completed stage to show "‚úÖ Completed" 
4. **Create new stage documents**: Follow naming convention (002-*, 003-*, etc.)

## Planning Reorganization (2025-07-01)

The planning structure has been reorganized to improve focus and deliverability:

1. **Stage 3 marked complete** - Core apply command functionality is fully implemented
2. **Stage 4 refocused** - Changed from portal pages/specs to API resources and their children
3. **Stage 5 created** - Dedicated to sync command implementation
4. **Stage 6 created** - Various improvements, UX enhancements, and comprehensive testing

This reorganization better reflects the implementation priorities and natural grouping of features.

## Planning Organization

- **Feature folders**: Each development effort has its own folder named after the PM's plan
- **Consistent naming**: Within each folder: `description.md`, `execution-plan-*.md`
- **Progress tracking**: Status fields maintained in execution plan steps
- **Cross-references**: Documents link to each other for context
- **Living documents**: Updated during implementation with notes and decisions
- **Current work indicator**: This index.md file always shows the active development effort

### Future Features

As new features are planned, they will be added to this index with their own folders and tracking. Examples might include:
- Authentication enhancements
- Additional resource types (routes, services, consumers)
- Performance optimizations
- Plugin system implementation
- CLI UX improvements
