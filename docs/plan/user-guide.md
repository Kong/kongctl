## üìã User Workflow Examples

### Starting a New Day of Development
```
User: Start a new development session with /start-session
Claude: [Runs checklist, reports status]

User: Show current development status with /status
Claude: [Shows current feature, progress, next steps]

User: Implement the next step with /implement-next
Claude: [Implements step, runs tests, updates tracking]
```

### Implementing Multiple Steps
```
User: Show the current plan with /show-plan
Claude: [Displays feature overview and all steps]

User: Implement step 2 with /implement-step 2
Claude: [Implements specific step]

User: Continue implementing with /implement-next
Claude: [Moves to next available step]

User: Run quality verification with /verify-quality
Claude: [Runs all quality checks]
```

### Completing a Feature
```
User: Show current development status with /status
Claude: [Shows all steps completed]

User: Complete the current feature with /complete-feature
Claude: [Finalizes feature, updates tracking]

User: Start new feature with /start-feature 005-auth-improvements
Claude: [Sets up new feature development]
```

## üåø Git Workflow

Our development follows a feature branch workflow:

### Branch Strategy
- **main**: Production-ready code
- **feature/[feature-name]**: Development branches for each feature
- Example: `feature/001-dec-cfg-cfg-format-basic-cli`

### Workflow Steps
1. **Start**: `/start-session` creates/switches to feature branch from latest main
2. **Develop**: Work on feature using `/implement-next` and other commands
3. **Complete**: `/complete-feature` creates PR for review
4. **Review**: Team reviews PR, provides feedback
5. **Merge**: PR gets merged to main after approval
6. **Next**: New `/start-session` starts fresh from updated main

### PR Guidelines
- Each feature gets its own PR
- Include comprehensive testing checklist
- Reference planning documents
- Wait for review before starting next feature

## üö® Important User Guidelines

### DO:
- Start each session with `/start-session` to establish context
- Use `/status` frequently to track progress
- Run `/verify-quality` after implementing multiple steps
- Commit changes regularly (ask Claude to commit after major milestones)
- Review ADRs with `/show-adrs` when making architectural decisions

### DON'T:
- Skip steps or implement out of order without good reason
- Forget to update status tracking (Claude should handle this automatically)
- Move to a new feature without completing the current one
- Ignore failing tests or lint issues

## üí° Tips for Effective Sessions

1. **Start Small**: Use `/implement-next` to work step by step rather than trying to implement everything at once

2. **Verify Often**: Use `/verify-quality` after each step or two to catch issues early

3. **Track Progress**: Use `/status` at the beginning and end of each session

4. **Understand Context**: Use `/show-plan` and `/show-adrs` to understand the bigger picture

5. **Clean Commits**: Ask Claude to commit with descriptive messages after completing each step or logical unit of work

## üîÑ Session Continuity

When resuming work across Claude Code sessions:

```
User: Start a new development session with /start-session
User: Show what was done in the last session (check recent commits)
User: Show current development status with /status
User: Continue with /implement-next
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

If things go wrong:

```
User: Run quality verification with /verify-quality
User: [If issues found] Fix the build/lint/test issues
User: Show current development status with /status
User: [If step is partially complete] Review and complete the current step
```

## üìù Custom Workflows

You can combine commands for specific workflows:

### Morning Standup Workflow
```
/start-session
/status
Show me what's planned for today
```

### End of Day Workflow
```
/status
/verify-quality
Commit all completed work with appropriate messages
Push changes to the planning branch
```

### Code Review Prep
```
/show-plan
/status
Show me all changes made for the current feature
/verify-quality
```

## üîß Command Implementation

The custom commands are implemented as markdown files in `.claude/commands/`:

- `start-session.md` - Session initialization with git branch setup
- `status.md` - Progress reporting and next steps
- `implement-next.md` - Step-by-step implementation with quality gates
- `implement-step.md` - Specific step implementation by number
- `verify-quality.md` - Comprehensive quality checks
- `show-plan.md` - Feature plan and step overview
- `show-adrs.md` - Architecture decision summaries
- `create-pr.md` - Pull request creation with proper formatting
- `complete-feature.md` - Feature finalization and PR workflow

Each command file contains detailed instructions for Claude Code to follow, ensuring consistent behavior and adherence to the development process.

---

**Remember**: These commands are designed to help Claude Code follow the established development process. Claude Code will understand these commands in the context of the planning documents and CLAUDE.md guidance.
