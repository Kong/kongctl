# Future Work

This directory contains ideas and designs for future features that are not currently prioritized for implementation.

## Purpose

The future work bucket serves to:
- Capture good ideas that arise during development
- Document features that are nice-to-have but not critical
- Preserve design thinking for potential future implementation
- Keep active stages focused on essential work

## Current Future Work Items

### [Configuration Discovery](configuration-discovery.md)
- **Description**: Show unmanaged fields to help users progressively build configurations
- **Priority**: Low
- **Value**: Improves user experience when adopting declarative configuration

## Adding Future Work

When adding new items to this directory:
1. Create a new markdown file with a descriptive name
2. Include problem statement, proposed solution, and use cases
3. Note why it's not currently prioritized
4. Add entry to this README

## Promoting Future Work

When a future work item becomes prioritized:
1. Move content to appropriate stage planning
2. Remove from this directory
3. Update this README

## Guidelines

- Keep ideas focused and well-documented
- Include enough detail for future implementation
- Note any dependencies or prerequisites
- Consider maintenance burden
