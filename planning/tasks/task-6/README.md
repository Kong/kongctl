# Task 6: Fix API Publications Creation Failure

## Overview

This task addressed a critical bug where API Publications would fail when created in the same plan as their parent APIs and portals, with the error "API ID is required for publication operations".

## Status: âœ… COMPLETED

## Documents

1. **[INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md](INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md)** - Initial investigation and root cause analysis
2. **[FLOW_REPORT.md](FLOW_REPORT.md)** - Detailed execution flow analysis showing where references were lost
3. **[PLAN.md](PLAN.md)** - Implementation plan (includes both original hypothesis and actual fix)
4. **[RESOLUTION_REPORT.md](RESOLUTION_REPORT.md)** - Final resolution details and test results

## Summary

### The Problem
- API Publications failed on first run when created with their parent resources
- Error: "API ID is required for publication operations"
- Second run would succeed (when APIs already existed)

### The Investigation
Through strategic debug logging, we discovered:
- The planner correctly created 2 references (`api_id` and `portal_id`)
- During execution, only 1 reference remained (`portal_id`)
- The `api_id` reference was being discarded

### The Root Cause
A single line in `planner.go` (line 207) was creating a new empty References map, discarding all existing references set by the planner.

### The Fix
```go
// Before:
basePlan.Changes[i].References = make(map[string]ReferenceInfo)

// After:
if basePlan.Changes[i].References == nil {
    basePlan.Changes[i].References = make(map[string]ReferenceInfo)
}
```

### Key Learnings
1. The propagation mechanism was working correctly
2. Simple bugs can cause complex symptoms
3. Strategic debug logging is invaluable
4. Understanding the distinction between Fields and References maps was crucial

## Impact
Users can now successfully create APIs, Portals, and API Publications in a single configuration file and apply them in one operation.
