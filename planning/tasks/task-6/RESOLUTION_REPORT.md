# Resolution Report: API Publications Fix

## Summary

The API Publications failure issue has been successfully resolved. The root cause was identified as a bug in the reference resolver that was overwriting the entire References map, discarding the `api_id` reference before execution began.

## The Fix

### Code Change

**File**: `/Users/rick.spurgeon@konghq.com/go/src/github.com/Kong/kongctl/internal/declarative/planner/planner.go`
**Line**: 207-210

```go
// Before (problematic code):
basePlan.Changes[i].References = make(map[string]ReferenceInfo)

// After (fixed code):
// Preserve existing references and merge with resolver results
if basePlan.Changes[i].References == nil {
    basePlan.Changes[i].References = make(map[string]ReferenceInfo)
}
```

This simple change ensures that references set by the planner are preserved and merged with any references found by the resolver, rather than being discarded.

## Debugging Process

### 1. Initial Investigation
- Added debug logging to trace reference lifecycle
- Discovered that planAPIPublicationCreate correctly set 2 references
- Found that during execution, only 1 reference remained

### 2. Key Discovery
Debug output revealed the critical insight:

**During Planning:**
```
[DEBUG] API Publication references: 2 references
[DEBUG]   api_id: ref='sms', id=''
[DEBUG]   portal_id: ref='getting-started', id=''
```

**During Execution:**
```
[DEBUG] Found matching change: type=api_publication, ref=sms-api-to-getting-started
[DEBUG] Change has 1 references
[DEBUG] Checking reference: key=portal_id, refType=portal, ref=getting-started
```

The `api_id` reference was completely missing!

### 3. Root Cause Analysis
- The ReferenceResolver only looks in the Fields map, not the References map
- It finds `portal_id` (which is in both Fields and References)
- It doesn't find `api_id` (which is only in References)
- Line 207 creates a new empty References map, discarding existing references
- Only references found by the resolver are restored

## Test Results

After implementing the fix:

```bash
./kongctl apply --plan plan.json --pat $(cat ~/.konnect/claude.pat)
```

**Output:**
```

All changes applied successfully on the first run!

## Why the Fix Works

1. **Preserves All References**: The fix ensures that references created by the planner (like `api_id`) are preserved even if the resolver doesn't find them in the Fields map.

2. **Enables Propagation**: With the `api_id` reference intact, the propagation mechanism can update it with the actual ID after the API is created.

3. **Maintains Compatibility**: The fix doesn't change the behavior for references that the resolver does find - it still updates those as before.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Reference vs Fields Distinction**: The codebase has two ways of storing references - the References map (for execution-time resolution) and the Fields map (for static values). Understanding this distinction was crucial.

2. **Propagation Works**: The propagation mechanism was working correctly all along. The issue was that it had no reference to propagate to.

3. **Debug Logging Importance**: Strategic debug logging at key points in the reference lifecycle was essential for identifying the exact point where references were lost.

4. **Simple Bugs, Complex Symptoms**: A single line creating a new map instead of checking for nil caused a complex failure pattern that only manifested in specific scenarios.

## Impact

This fix enables users to:
- Define APIs and their publications in the same configuration file
- Apply all changes in a single plan execution
- Avoid the need for multiple runs or manual workarounds

The fix is minimal, safe, and preserves all existing functionality while solving the critical issue.
