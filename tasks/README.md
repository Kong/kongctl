# Tasks Directory

This directory contains task-based development artifacts for ad-hoc tasks and GitHub issue resolutions.

## Task Types

### GitHub Issues (`gh-XX/`)
Tasks created from GitHub issues using `/task gh-39` command. These directories contain:
- **GITHUB_ISSUE.md**: Automatically fetched issue details from GitHub
- **INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md**: Code investigation findings
- **FLOW_REPORT.md**: Code flow analysis
- **PLAN.md**: Implementation plan

### Ad-hoc Tasks (`task-XX/`)
General development tasks created using `/task <description>` command. These contain the standard three reports generated by the task subagents.

## Usage

To create a new task:
- **GitHub Issue**: `/task gh-39` (where 39 is the issue number)
- **Ad-hoc Task**: `/task fix memory leak in portal creation`

The task system will:
1. Validate git environment is clean
2. Create appropriate directory structure
3. Create and checkout a git branch
4. Run investigation, flow analysis, and planning subagents
5. Present a plan for approval

## Note on Planning Stage Tasks

Tasks related to planning stages (e.g., `/task 008-external-resources`) are stored within their respective planning directories at `planning/XXX/tasks/task-YY/` to keep feature implementation artifacts together with planning documents.
